# Logout Data Persistence Fix

## Problem
Data was persisting after page refresh but disappearing after logout and login again. This indicated that:
1. LocalStorage was working (data persisted on refresh)
2. Firestore data was not being properly saved or loaded when users logged out and back in

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the data loading and logout logic:

1. **Incomplete localStorage cleanup on logout** - Old localStorage data from previous sessions was interfering with fresh logins
2. **Insufficient Firestore data prioritization** - The system was sometimes preferring localStorage data over Firestore data, which caused inconsistencies when users logged in from different devices or after clearing localStorage
3. **Inadequate debug logging** - Made it difficult to track exactly what was happening during the data flow

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logout Data Cleanup
```javascript
// Reset on logout and clear localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user) {
    console.log('User logged out, clearing data and localStorage')
    dispatch({ type: "CLEAR_ALL_DATA" })
    // Clear all localStorage data
    try {
      if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
        // Clear all budgetTrackerData entries
        const keys = Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith("budgetTrackerData"))
        keys.forEach(key => localStorage.removeItem(key))
        console.log('Cleared localStorage keys:', keys)
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Error clearing localStorage:', e)
    }
    setLoading(false)
  } else {
    console.log('User logged in:', user.uid)
  }
}, [user])
```

### 2. Improved Data Loading Priority
Modified the data hydration logic to:
- **Always prioritize Firestore data** as the source of truth when available
- **Enhanced debug logging** to track each step of the data loading process
- **Better error handling** with detailed console logs
- **Proper localStorage synchronization** with Firestore data

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging throughout the data flow:
- User login/logout events
- Firestore data loading and saving
- localStorage operations
- Data normalization steps
- Error conditions

## Key Changes Made

### In `BudgetContext.jsx`:

1. **Enhanced logout cleanup** - Now properly clears all localStorage entries that start with "budgetTrackerData"

2. **Improved data loading logic** - Always uses Firestore as the primary source when available, then syncs to localStorage

3. **Better debug logging** - Comprehensive console logs to track data flow

4. **Robust error handling** - Proper fallbacks and error logging

## Testing Instructions

1. **Login and add some data** (categories, expenses, income)
2. **Refresh the page** - Data should persist ✅
3. **Logout completely**
4. **Login again** - All your data should be there ✅
5. **Check browser console** for debug logs showing the data flow

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Data persists after page refresh
- ✅ Data persists after logout and login again
- ✅ Data is properly isolated per user account
- ✅ Firestore serves as the primary source of truth
- ✅ localStorage serves as a local backup/cache
- ✅ Clear debug logging helps troubleshoot any issues

## Debug Console Output

When working correctly, you should see logs like:
```
User logged in: [user-uid]
Starting data hydration for user: [user-uid]
Found existing data in Firestore: [data-object]
Loaded Firestore data: [data-object]
Updated localStorage with Firestore data
```

When logging out:
```
User logged out, clearing data and localStorage
Cleared localStorage keys: ["budgetTrackerData", "budgetTrackerData:[user-uid]"]
```
